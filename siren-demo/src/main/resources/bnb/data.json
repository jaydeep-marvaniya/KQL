Toplak.","abstract":"\"In this book, Keith Stanovich attempts to resolve the Great Rationality Debate in cognitive science-the debate about how much irrationality to ascribe to human cognition. Stanovich shows how the insights of dual-process theory and evolutionary psychology can be combined to explain why humans are sometimes irrational even though they possess cognitive machinery of remarkable adaptiveness. Using a unique individual differences approach, Stanovich shows that to fully characterize differences in rational thinking, the traditional System 2 of dual-process theory must be partitioned into the reflective mind and the algorithmic mind. He posits that we need to supersede dual-process theories with tripartite models of cognition. The key operations of the algorithmic mind and the reflective mind that support human rationality are discussed in the book. The key function of the algorithmic mind is to sustain the processing of decoupled secondary representations in cognitive simulation. The key function of the reflective mind, in contrast, is to detect the need to interrupt autonomous processing and to begin simulation activities. Stanovich uses the algorithmic\/reflective distinction to develop a taxonomy of cognitive errors that are made on tasks in the heuristics and biases literature. He presents empirical data to show that the tendency to make these thinking errors is only modestly related to intelligence. Using the new tripartite model of mind, Stanovich shows how rationality is a more encompassing construct than intelligence-when both are properly defined-and that IQ tests fail to assess individual differences in rational thought. Stanovich discusses the types of thinking processes that would be measured in an assessment of rational thinking\"--Provided by publisher.","description":"Includes bibliographical references and index.","subject":["Reasoning (Psychology)","Individual differences","Intellect","Cognition"],"notation":"153.43","cid":"(Uk)015760654","identifier":[{"id":"(Uk)015760654","type":"BNB"},{"id":"GBB205569","type":"BNB"},{"id":"9780195341140","type":"isbn"},{"id":"0195341147","type":"isbn"}]}

Veteran educators are not alone. Early retirement promotions have become the norm for aging workers in America. There is a brain-drain of skilled workers at the national, state, and local level. The early retirement of our most talented veteran educators is leaving our schools without the necessary leadership, hard-earned experience, skills, and wisdom to meet the complex challenges our country faces in our complex world. Indeed there are long-term consequences of losing skilled educators while they are in the prime of their professional lives. This book challenges the : good news only\" theory of early retirement promotions which suggest that veteran educators are no longer needed as they age and their retirement is the only way schools can survive financially in these tough times. It's a \" no problem here\" approach that says everyone gets a reward. The novice educators get a job and the vets get some cash. No problem that is until the veteran educators are out the door and the school staff, students, and parents are left without their steady guiding hand. This book focuses on why it is imperative that we offer our most gifted veteran educators career alternatives that will encourage and reward them to remain on board , continuing to provide leadership and be role models for novice and mid-career staff, students, parents, and community members\"--Provided by publisher.","description":"Includes bibliographical references.","subject":["Teacher turnover--United States--Prevention","Employee retention--United States","Teacher effectiveness--United States","Teachers--Retirement--United States","Older people--Employment--United States","Teaching--Vocational guidance--United States","School personnel management--United States"],"notation":"371.14","cid":"(Uk)016007392","identifier":[{"id":"(Uk)016007392","type":"BNB"},{"id":"GBB206000","type":"BNB"},{"id":"9781610483360","type":"isbn"},{"id":"1610483367","type":"isbn"},{"id":"9781610483377","type":"isbn"},{"id":"1610483375","type":"isbn"}]}
