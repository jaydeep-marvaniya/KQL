This module extends the lucene-queryparser module to provide a number of query 
parsers to easily create complex queries through rich query languages. 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Currently, there are two query languages:

<ul>
  <li> The <b>keyword query language</b>: proposes a language that is designed for 
  human-centric interaction. It is based on the Lucene's standard query syntax
  and includes syntactic sugar inspired from the JSON syntax for querying nested
  objects.
  <li> The <b>JSON query language</b>: proposes an advanced language that is designed 
  for program-centric interaction. This language is a simple JSON serialisation 
  of the search API of siren-core and covers all the search features of SIREn.
</ul>
